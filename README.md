Welcome to my 100 Days CSS Challenge! In this challenge, I will be participating in the popular [100 Days CSS Challenge](https://100dayscss.com/days/1/), creating exciting CSS designs and animations daily. All of my creations will be showcased on CodePen, and I will also upload them to GitHub daily to track my progress.

## üåü Objective

The objective of this challenge is to sharpen my CSS skills, explore creative animations, and experiment with unique design concepts. Each day, I will take on a new CSS challenge, pushing the boundaries of awhat I can achieve with CSS.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The GitHub repository will be organized as follows:

- Each day's CSS challenge will be in a separate folder, labeled with the day number.
- Inside each folder, there will be an `index.html` file with the CodePen embed code for the challenge.
- Additional assets or images used in the challenge will also be included in the folder.
- The `README.md` file for each day's challenge will provide a brief description and a preview image of the CSS design.

## üöÄ Daily Updates

Throughout the 100 Days CSS Challenge, I will commit and push my progress daily to the GitHub repository. This way, anyone interested can follow along with my journey and witness the evolution of my CSS skills.

## üåê Live CodePen Demos

You can view each CSS challenge in action and play around with the code on my CodePen profile ‚û°Ô∏è [CodePen Profile](https://codepen.io/rahil1202)
